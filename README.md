# Next.js + Tailwind  Airbnb simple Clone.
This is the first project I have build using NextJS and tailwind.I couldn't build a similar ( frontEnd side) airbnb clone, but I was excited to try NextJs for the first time.<br>
I enjoyed using Tailwind ( as a nerd css writer ); Spending less time writing css was a deal breacker for sure.<br>
I used MapBox API to integrate map interface to my search components based on the geolocation of the airbnb stays (dummy data) generated.<br>
Clone the github repo , install the necessary dependencies and get your mapbox public token ( to use the map | and yep it's for free ) .<br>
Have a great day!<br>
